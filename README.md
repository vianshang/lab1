homework 1 
declare a main function to show a sequence
declare "number" to save data 
declare "a" represent the remainder of number%2
Let number be input and scan it into the "number"
print out the header of the sequence
enter while loop if the number be input is not equal to 1
Let then number%2 and check the remainder a
if the remainder "a" equal to 1 (indicate the number is odd) then do the calculate (multipulate 3 and plus one ) and print the result
if the remainder "a" equal to 0 (indicate the number is even) then do the calculate (divided by 2 ) and print the result
Not until the number equal to one does the program stop
Then the result sequence be printed on screen
