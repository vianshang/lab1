Homework 1 PartB
Declare a main function to show a sequence.
Declare "number" to save data.
Declare "a" represent the remainder of number%2.
Let number be input and scan it into the "number".
Print out the header of the sequence.
Enter while loop if the number be input is not equal to 1.
Let then number%2 and check the remainder "a".
If the remainder "a" equal to 1 (indicate the number is odd) then do the calculate (multipulate 3 and plus one ) and print the result.
If the remainder "a" equal to 0 (indicate the number is even) then do the calculate (divided by 2 ) and print the result.
Not until the number equal to one does the program stop.
Then the result sequence be printed on screen.
